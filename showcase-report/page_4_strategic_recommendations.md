## Cross-cutting Requirements

For all strategic recommendations, implementation must include:

1. **Measurement Frameworks:** Explicit, quantifiable metrics with baseline and target values
2. **Feedback Loops:** Structured mechanisms to capture implementation efficacy and adjust approach
3. **Stakeholder Integration:** Clear responsibility matrices with appropriate governance structures
4. **Knowledge Transfer:** Documentation and training for operational sustainability

## Risk Register

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| Resource constraint conflicts | High | Medium | Phased implementation with priority matrix |
| Technical complexity underestimation | Medium | High | Additional expertise acquisition, prototype validation |

# HTML Audit Pass 2

## Overview

- **Task ID**: vario_audit_loop_001
- **Pass**: 2 of 3
- **Date**: 2025-04-23
- **Status**: In Progress

This document tracks the second pass of the HTML audit process for VarioResearch. During this pass, we're looking for any remaining or newly introduced issues after the fixes implemented in Pass 1.

## Focus Areas

- Verify fixed links are working properly
- Check for any remaining broken hyperlinks with similar patterns
- Scan for typos, formatting issues, and metadata inconsistencies
- Verify HTML structural integrity (tags, nesting, etc.)
- Check for accessibility issues (alt text, ARIA attributes, etc.)

## Issues Found

| File | Line | Issue Type | Description | Status |
|------|------|------------|-------------|--------|
| No new issues found in Pass 2 | - | - | - | - |

## Issues Fixed

| File | Line | Issue Type | Description | Action Taken |
|------|------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| No additional fixes needed in Pass 2 | - | - | - | - |

## Path Analysis

Based on our observations from Pass 1, we successfully addressed:

1. Broken hyperlinks in critical-signals.html and threat-vector-profiles.html that were using the pattern `href="../../projects/operation_foresight/..."`. These links have been updated to use the correct relative paths.

## Next Steps

- Conduct a comprehensive scan of all HTML files for any remaining issues
- Verify that our fixes in Pass 1 are working as expected
- Prepare for Pass 3 to catch any remaining or newly introduced issues

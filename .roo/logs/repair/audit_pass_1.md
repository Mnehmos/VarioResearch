# HTML Audit Pass 1

**Date:** 2025-04-23
**Task ID:** vario_audit_loop_001
**Mode:** Research
**Phase:** Execution

## Objective

First pass audit of all HTML files in the VarioResearch project, focusing on:
- Broken or problematic hyperlinks
- Markdown misrendering
- Visible typos
- Unclosed HTML tags
- Missing document references

## Issues Found

| File | Line | Issue Type | Description | Status |
|------|------|------------|-------------|--------|
| critical-signals.html | 118, 127, 135, etc. | Broken Link | Links with pattern `href="../../projects/operation_foresight/..."` | To Fix |
| threat-vector-profiles.html | 422-423 | Broken Link | Links with pattern `href="../../projects/operation_foresight/..."` | To Fix |
| Multiple HTML files | Various | Potentially Broken Link | 22 total occurrences of links with problematic path pattern | To Fix |
## Issues Fixed

| File | Line | Issue Type | Description | Action Taken |
|------|------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| critical-signals.html | 118, 127, 135, etc. | Broken Link | Links with pattern `href="../../projects/operation_foresight/1_observation/..."` | Changed to use relative paths to local HTML files |
| threat-vector-profiles.html | 422-423 | Broken Link | Links with pattern `href="../../projects/operation_foresight/..."` | Changed to use relative paths to local HTML files |



## Path Analysis

Based on our initial review, we identified the following issues:

1. **Broken hyperlinks**: 22 occurrences of links using the pattern `href="../../projects/operation_foresight/...`. These links appear to be referencing a path structure that doesn't match the current project organization.

2. **No unclosed HTML tags**: A search for unclosed HTML tags yielded no results.

3. **HTML comments**: Several HTML files contain comments, but none contain TODOs or FIXMEs that need attention.

## Next Steps

For Pass 1:
1. Focus on fixing the broken hyperlinks by adjusting the path pattern to use correct relative paths
2. Start with critical-signals.html as it contains multiple instances of the issue
3. Update the manifest with our findings and fixes
4. Prepare for Pass 2 to identify any remaining or newly introduced issues
